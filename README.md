dType is a lightweight distraction-free text editor for Android. It features a minimalistic interface and an original export/save system. It’s a quick-to-load, distraction-free interface layer between the idea and any app/format of choice.

## Building

dType source code is distributed in a form of Eclipse project. It requires the following dependencies to be satisfied:

* JVM and JDK
* Eclipse Java IDE
* Android SDK
* ADT plugin for Eclipse

These are the common prerequisites for general-purpose Android development. You can get more information on installing and configuring these on the official [Android developers resources](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

Simply import the project and install the required library to get rid of the error. Android SDK even provides a way to do that automatically: right click on the project → `Android Tools` → `Add Support Library`.
